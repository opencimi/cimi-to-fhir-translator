// technically, this is more accurate, but everyone uses high wrongly because the definition is counter-intuitive: 
//   ivlts.lowhigh: for src.low as low, src.high as high make tgt.start = low, tgt.end = dateOp(high, "rotate-left") 
// where rotate-left means to rotate the date on the start of the period e.g. 2013-01-23 becomes 2013-01-22

// we could, I suppose, fill out all the variants - eg. low+center, high+width, etc, and we will if anyone encounters them in the wild.
// todo: do we need to consider inclusive in the mappings?
